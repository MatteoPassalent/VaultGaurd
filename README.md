# VaultGaurd
Flask web app that stores user accounts and passwords. Users can log in and save the information for their online accounts.

Used Flask to create a RESTful API that handles HTTP requests and generates appropriate JSON responses. Designed the user interface with Javascript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery. Stored user information in an embedded database using SQLite. Developed a user authentication system using Flask-Login and used the Werkzeug library to hash user password information.
